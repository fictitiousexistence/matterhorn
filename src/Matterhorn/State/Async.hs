-- * Background Computation

-- $background_computation
--
-- The main context for Matterhorn is the EventM context provided by
-- the 'Brick' library.  This context is normally waiting for user
-- input (or terminal resizing, etc.) which gets turned into an
-- MHEvent and the 'onEvent' event handler is called to process that
-- event, after which the display is redrawn as necessary and brick
-- awaits the next input.
--
-- However, it is often convenient to communicate with the Mattermost
-- server in the background, so that large numbers of
-- synchronously-blocking events (e.g. on startup) or refreshes can
-- occur whenever needed and without negatively impacting the UI
-- updates or responsiveness.  This is handled by a 'forkIO' context
-- that waits on an STM channel for work to do, performs the work, and
-- then sends brick an MHEvent containing the completion or failure
-- information for that work.
--
-- The /doAsyncWith/ family of functions here facilitates that
-- asynchronous functionality.  This is typically used in the
-- following fashion:
--
-- > doSomething :: MH ()
-- > doSomething = do
-- >    got <- something
-- >    doAsyncWith Normal $ do
-- >       r <- mmFetchR ....
-- >       return $ do
-- >          csSomething.here %= processed r
--
-- The second argument is an IO monad operation (because 'forkIO' runs
-- in the IO Monad context), but it returns an MH monad operation.
-- The IO monad has access to the closure of 'doSomething' (e.g. the
-- 'got' value), but it should be aware that the state of the MH monad
-- may have been changed by the time the IO monad runs in the
-- background, so the closure is a snapshot of information at the time
-- the 'doAsyncWith' was called.
--
-- Similarly, the returned MH monad operation is *not* run in the
-- context of the 'forkIO' background, but it is instead passed via an
-- MHEvent back to the main brick thread, where it is executed in an
-- EventM handler's MH monad context.  This operation therefore has
-- access to the combined closure of the pre- 'doAsyncWith' code and
-- the closure of the IO operation.  It is important that the final MH
-- monad operation should *re-obtain* state information from the MH
-- monad instead of using or setting the state obtained prior to the
-- 'doAsyncWith' call.
